Stack is an ADT (abstract data type) that acts like a list of objects but there is a difference.

Stack works on the principle of {\itshape LIFO} (Last In First Out), it means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item to be removed.

Stack is based on two methods (functions)-\/\hypertarget{md_src_main_java_com_thealgorithms_datastructures_stacks__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md25}{}\doxysection{push(element)}\label{md_src_main_java_com_thealgorithms_datastructures_stacks__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md25}
It adds \char`\"{}element\char`\"{} to the top of the stack.

For example\+: If we have {\ttfamily 1, 3, 5} in stack, and we call push(9),

{\ttfamily 9} will be added to last index of stack -\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} {\ttfamily 1, 3, 5 , 9}.\hypertarget{md_src_main_java_com_thealgorithms_datastructures_stacks__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md26}{}\doxysection{peek() or top()}\label{md_src_main_java_com_thealgorithms_datastructures_stacks__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md26}
It returns element at the top of the stack.

For example\+: If we have {\ttfamily 1, 3, 5} in stack, and we call peek(),

{\ttfamily 5} will be returned (without removing it from the stack).\hypertarget{md_src_main_java_com_thealgorithms_datastructures_stacks__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md27}{}\doxysection{pop()}\label{md_src_main_java_com_thealgorithms_datastructures_stacks__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md27}
It removes the last element (i.\+e. top of stack) from stack.

For example\+: If we have {\ttfamily 1, 3, 5 , 9} in stack, and we call pop(),

the function will return {\ttfamily 9} and the stack will change to {\ttfamily 1, 3, 5}.
