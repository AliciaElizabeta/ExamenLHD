The \fBMandelbrot\fP set is the set of complex numbers 'c' for which the series 'z_(n+1) = z_n * z_n + c' does not diverge, i\&.e\&. remains bounded\&. Thus, a complex number 'c' is a member of the \fBMandelbrot\fP set if, when starting with 'z_0 = 0' and applying the iteration repeatedly, the absolute value of 'z_n' remains bounded for all 'n > 0'\&. Complex numbers can be written as 'a + b*i': 'a' is the real component, usually drawn on the x-axis, and 'b*i' is the imaginary component, usually drawn on the y-axis\&. Most visualizations of the \fBMandelbrot\fP set use a color-coding to indicate after how many steps in the series the numbers outside the set cross the divergence threshold\&. Images of the \fBMandelbrot\fP set exhibit an elaborate and infinitely complicated boundary that reveals progressively ever-finer recursive detail at increasing magnifications, making the boundary of the \fBMandelbrot\fP set a fractal curve\&.

Method to generate the image of the \fBMandelbrot\fP set\&. Two types of coordinates are used: image-coordinates that refer to the pixels and figure-coordinates that refer to the complex numbers inside and outside the \fBMandelbrot\fP set\&. The figure-coordinates in the arguments of this method determine which section of the \fBMandelbrot\fP set is viewed\&. The main area of the \fBMandelbrot\fP set is roughly between '-1\&.5 < x < 0\&.5' and '-1 <
y < 1' in the figure-coordinates\&.
