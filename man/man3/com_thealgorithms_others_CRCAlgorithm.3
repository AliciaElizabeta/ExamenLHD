\fIstr\fP The binary number P, in a string form, which is used by the CRC algorithm

.SS "void com\&.thealgorithms\&.others\&.CRCAlgorithm\&.changeMess ()"
Once the message is transmitted, some of it's elements, is possible to change from 1 to 0, or from 0 to 1, because of the Bit Error Rate (ber)\&. For every element of the message, a random double number is created\&. If that number is smaller than ber, then the spesific element changes\&. On the other hand, if it's bigger than ber, it does not\&. Based on these changes\&. the boolean variable messageChanged, gets the value: true, or false\&. 
.SS "void com\&.thealgorithms\&.others\&.CRCAlgorithm\&.divideMessageWithP (boolean check)"
The most significant part of the CRC algorithm\&. The message is divided by P, so the dividedMessage ArrayList<Integer> is created\&. If check == true, the dividedMessaage is examined, in order to see if it contains any 1's\&. If it does, the message is considered to be wrong by the receiver,so the variable wrongMessCaught changes\&. If it does not, it is accepted, so one of the variables correctMess, wrongMessNotCaught, changes\&. If check == false, the diviided Message is added at the end of the ArrayList<integer> message\&.

\fIcheck\fP the variable used to determine, if the message is going to be checked from the receiver if true, it is checked otherwise, it is not

.SS "void com\&.thealgorithms\&.others\&.CRCAlgorithm\&.refactor ()"
Resets some of the object's values, used on the main function, so that it can be re-used, in order not to waste too much memory and time, by creating new objects\&.
