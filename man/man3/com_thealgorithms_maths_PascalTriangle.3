In mathematics, Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients that arises in probability theory, combinatorics, and algebra\&. In much of the Western world, it is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although other mathematicians studied it centuries before him in India, Persia, China, Germany, and Italy\&.

The rows of Pascal's triangle are conventionally enumerated starting with row n=0 at the top (the 0th row)\&. The entries in each row are numbered from the left beginning with k=0 and are usually staggered relative to the numbers in the adjacent rows\&. The triangle may be constructed in the following manner: In row 0 (the topmost row), there is a unique nonzero entry 1\&. Each entry of each subsequent row is constructed by adding the number above and to the left with the number above and to the right, treating blank entries as 0\&. For example, the initial number in the first (or any other) row is 1 (the sum of 0 and 1), whereas the numbers 1 and 3 in the third row are added to produce the number 4 in the fourth row\&. *
