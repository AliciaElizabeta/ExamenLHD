<title>Detailed Description</title>

<para>Amicable numbers are two different numbers so related that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number. (A proper divisor of a number is a positive factor of that number other than the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3.) A pair of amicable numbers constitutes an aliquot sequence of period 2. It is unknown if there are infinitely many pairs of amicable numbers. *</para>

<para>Simple Example : (220,284) 220 is divisible by {1,2,4,5,10,11,20,22,44,55,110 } &lt;- Sum = 284 284 is divisible by -&gt; 1,2,4,71,142 and the Sum of that is. Yes right you probably expected it 220 </para>
